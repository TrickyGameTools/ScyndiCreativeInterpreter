# License Q & A

Scyndi's Creative Interpreter has been licensed under the terms of the GPL3.
The terms of this license are well known and could be found all over the internet, but a few things have always been a bit confusing here, due to the "viral" nature of this license.


## The GPL requires that all sources using GPL licensed source files are GPL3 as well. Does that mean I have to publish all games that use SCI?

No. The GPL only applies to source codes of Scyndi's Creative Interpreter itself or programs using portions of its source code in order to be compiled.  The scripting code for your games, the assets, the story, well everything, is considered "the data". The GPL3 does not apply to the data, which has been officially confirmed by the guys behind GNU themselves.

## So that does mean I can create close sourced projects with them and even sell them?

Yes!

## May I include the SCI runtime binaries with them when I sell a game made with with SCI?

Yes! GPL3 states clearly that the binaries made from GPL licensed source codes may be included in sold packages, and as such Scyndi's Creative Interpreter is no exception. There is a little rub, though. The SCI interpreter is and remains GPL3 licensed. If your project uses a modified version of Scyndi's Creative interpreter that also means that you must publish de modified source code under the same license, and make sure the modified version and its source code remain free.

## But if I make a game with a modified version of SCI, may the game itself still be closed sourced?

Yes! The engine must then be freely available with all source code and stuff. Your scripts and assets etc. Will remain yours, unless the modified version of SCI may require them in order to compile, but how it works then could make things a bit complicated.




I hope this clarifies a few things.
